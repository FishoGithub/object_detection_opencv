# AI Object Detection with Python OpenCV

A small side-project I created over one night. Utilizes the OpenCV python library and device webcam to idenitfy the current object being displayed to the webcam. 

Originally built as part of a fun side-project with @liamkinsella, in which we built both a bow, a target, and this program to track and identify when an arrow shot by the bow would come in contact with the target, and as it came in contact, would play a sound.
